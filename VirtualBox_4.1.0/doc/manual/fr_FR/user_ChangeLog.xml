  <para>This section summarizes the changes between VirtualBox versions. Note
  that this change log is not exhaustive; not all changes are listed.</para>

  <para>VirtualBox version numbers consist of three numbers separated by dots
  where the first and second number represent the major version and the 3rd number
  the minor version. Minor version numbers of official releases are always even.
  An odd minor version number represents an internal development or test build.
  In addition, each build contains a revision number.</para>
