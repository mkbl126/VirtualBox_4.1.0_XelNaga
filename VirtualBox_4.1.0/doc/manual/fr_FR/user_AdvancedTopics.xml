    <title>VirtualBox configuration data</title>

    <para>For each system user, VirtualBox stores configuration data in the
    user's home directory, as per the conventions of the host operating
    system:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>On Windows, this is
          <computeroutput>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.VirtualBox</computeroutput>;
          typically something like <computeroutput>C:\Documents and
          Settings\Username\.VirtualBox</computeroutput>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>On Mac OS X, this is
          <computeroutput>$HOME/Library/VirtualBox</computeroutput>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>On Unix-like systems (Linux, Solaris), this is
          <computeroutput>$HOME/.VirtualBox</computeroutput>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>VirtualBox creates this configuration directory automatically, if
    necessary. Optionally, you can supply an alternate configuration directory
    by setting the
    <computeroutput><literal>VBOX_USER_HOME</literal></computeroutput>
    environment variable. You can globally change some of the locations where
    VirtualBox keeps extra configuration and data by selecting "Global
    settings" from the "File" menu in the VirtualBox main window. Then, in the
    window that pops up, click on the "General" tab.</para>

    <para>VirtualBox stores all its global and machine-specific configuration
    data in XML documents. We intentionally do not document the specifications
    of these files, as we must reserve the right to modify them in the future.
    We therefore strongly suggest that you do not edit these files manually.
    VirtualBox provides complete access to its configuration data through its
    the <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> command line tool (see
    <xref linkend="vboxmanage" />) and its API (see <xref
    linkend="VirtualBoxAPI" />).</para>

    <para>The XML files are versioned. When a new settings file is created
    (e.g. because a new virtual machine is created), VirtualBox automatically
    uses the settings format of the current VirtualBox version. These files
    may not be readable if you downgrade to an earlier version of VirtualBox.
    However, when VirtualBox encounters a settings file from an earlier
    version (e.g. after upgrading VirtualBox), it attempts to preserve the
    settings format as much as possible. It will only silently upgrade the
    settings format if the current settings cannot be expressed in the old
    format, for example because you enabled a feature that was not present in
    an earlier version of VirtualBox.<footnote>
        <para>As an example, before VirtualBox 3.1, it was only possible to
        enable or disable a single DVD drive in a virtual machine. If it was
        enabled, then it would always be visible as the secondary master of
        the IDE controller. With VirtualBox 3.1, DVD drives can be attached to
        arbitrary slots of arbitrary controllers, so they could be the
        secondary slave of an IDE controller or in a SATA slot. If you have a
        machine settings file from an earlier version and upgrade VirtualBox
        to 3.1 and then move the DVD drive from its default position, this
        cannot be expressed in the old settings format; the XML machine file
        would get written in the new format, and a backup file of the old
        format would be kept.</para>
      </footnote> In such cases, VirtualBox backs up the old settings file in
    the virtual machine's configuration directory. If you need to go back to
    the earlier version of VirtualBox, then you will need to manually copy
    these backup files back.</para>

    <para>In detail, the following settings files are in use:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>In the configuration directory,
          <computeroutput>VirtualBox.xml</computeroutput> is the main
          configuration file. This includes global configuration options and
          the media and virtual machine registry. The media registry links to
          all CD/DVD, floppy and disk images that have been added to the
          Virtual Media Manager. For each registered VM, there is one entry
          which points to the VM configuration file, also in XML
          format.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Virtual machine settings and files are, by default, saved as
          XML files in a subdirectory of the
          <computeroutput>Machines</computeroutput> directory, which
          VirtualBox creates under the main configuration directory (see
          above). You can change the location of this main "Machines" folder
          in the "Global settings" dialog.</para>

          <para>By default, for each virtual machine, VirtualBox uses another
          subdirectory of the "Machines" directory that carries the same name
          as the virtual machine. As a result, your virtual machine names must
          conform to the conventions of your operating system for valid file
          names. For example, a machine called "Fedora 6" would, by default,
          have its settings saved in
          <computeroutput>.VirtualBox/Machines/Fedora 6/Fedora
          6.xml</computeroutput> (on a Linux or Solaris host).</para>

          <para>If you would like more control over the file names used, you
          can create the machine using <computeroutput>VBoxManage
          createvm</computeroutput> with the
          <computeroutput>--settingsfile</computeroutput> option; see <xref
          linkend="vboxmanage-createvm" />.</para>

          <para>The virtual machine directory will be renamed if you change
          the machine name. If you do not wish this to happen, you can create
          the machine using <computeroutput>VBoxManage
          createvm</computeroutput> with the
          <computeroutput>--basefolder</computeroutput> option. In this case,
          the folder name will never change.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>VirtualBox keeps snapshots and saved states in another special
          folder for each virtual machine. By default, this is a subfolder of
          the virtual machine folder called
          <computeroutput>Snapshots</computeroutput> -- in our example,
          <computeroutput>.VirtualBox/Machines/Fedora
          6/Snapshots</computeroutput>. You can change this setting for each
          machine using <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> as
          well.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>VDI container files are, by default, created in the
          <computeroutput>HardDisks</computeroutput> directory under the main
          configuration directory (see above). In particular, this directory
          is used when the "Create new virtual disk" wizard is started to
          create a new VDI file. Changing this default is probably most useful
          if the disk containing your home directory does not have enough room
          to hold your VDI files, which can grow very large.</para>

    <title>VBoxSDL, the simplified VM displayer</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>VBoxSDL is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that lacks the
      nice point-and-click support which VirtualBox, our main GUI, provides.
      VBoxSDL is currently primarily used internally for debugging VirtualBox
      and therefore not officially supported. Still, you may find it useful
      for environments where the virtual machines are not necessarily
      controlled by the same person that uses the virtual machine.<note>
          <para>VBoxSDL is not available on the Mac OS X host platform.</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>As you can see in the following screenshot, VBoxSDL does indeed
      only provide a simple window that contains only the "pure" virtual
      machine, without menus or other controls to click upon and no additional
      indicators of virtual machine activity:</para>

      <para><mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject></para>

      <para>To start a virtual machine with VBoxSDL instead of the VirtualBox
      GUI, enter the following on a command line:<screen>VBoxSDL --startvm &lt;vm&gt;</screen></para>

      <para>where <computeroutput>&lt;vm&gt;</computeroutput> is, as usual
      with VirtualBox command line parameters, the name or UUID of an existing
      virtual machine.</para>

      <title>Secure labeling with VBoxSDL</title>

      <para>When running guest operating systems in fullscreen mode, the guest
      operating system usually has control over the whole screen. This could
      present a security risk as the guest operating system might fool the
      user into thinking that it is either a different system (which might
      have a higher security level) or it might present messages on the screen
      that appear to stem from the host operating system.</para>

      <para>In order to protect the user against the above mentioned security
      risks, the secure labeling feature has been developed. Secure labeling
      is currently available only for VBoxSDL. When enabled, a portion of the
      display area is reserved for a label in which a user defined message is
      displayed. The label height in set to 20 pixels in VBoxSDL. The label
      font color and background color can be optionally set as hexadecimal RGB
      color values. The following syntax is used to enable secure
      labeling:</para>

      <screen>VBoxSDL --startvm "VM name"
      --securelabel --seclabelfnt ~/fonts/arial.ttf
      --seclabelsiz 14 --seclabelfgcol 00FF00 --seclabelbgcol 00FFFF</screen>

      <para>In addition to enabling secure labeling, a TrueType font has to be
      supplied. To use another font size than 12 point use the parameter
      <computeroutput>--seclabelsiz</computeroutput>.</para>

      <para>The label text can be set with <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxSDL/SecureLabel" "The Label"</screen>
      Changing this label will take effect immediately.</para>

      <para>Typically, full screen resolutions are limited to certain
      "standard" geometries such as 1024 x 768. Increasing this by twenty
      lines is not usually feasible, so in most cases, VBoxSDL will chose the
      next higher resolution, e.g. 1280 x 1024 and the guest's screen will not
      cover the whole display surface. If VBoxSDL is unable to choose a higher
      resolution, the secure label will be painted on top of the guest's
      screen surface. In order to address the problem of the bottom part of
      the guest screen being hidden, VBoxSDL can provide custom video modes to
      the guest that are reduced by the height of the label. For Windows
      guests and recent Solaris and Linux guests, the VirtualBox Guest
      Additions automatically provide the reduced video modes. Additionally,
      the VESA BIOS has been adjusted to duplicate its standard mode table
      with adjusted resolutions. The adjusted mode IDs can be calculated using
      the following formula:</para>

      <screen>reduced_modeid = modeid + 0x30</screen>

      <para>For example, in order to start Linux with 1024 x 748 x 16, the
      standard mode 0x117 (1024 x 768 x 16) is used as a base. The Linux video
      mode kernel parameter can then be calculated using:</para>

      <screen>vga = 0x200 | 0x117 + 0x30
vga = 839</screen>

      <para>The reason for duplicating the standard modes instead of only
      supplying the adjusted modes is that most guest operating systems
      require the standard VESA modes to be fixed and refuse to start with
      different modes.</para>

      <para>When using the X.org VESA driver, custom modelines have to be
      calculated and added to the configuration (usually in
      <literal>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</literal>. A handy tool to determine
      modeline entries can be found at <literal><ulink
      url="http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/faq/vga2rgb/calc.html">http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/faq/vga2rgb/calc.html</ulink></literal>.)</para>

      <title>Releasing modifiers with VBoxSDL on Linux</title>

      <para>When switching from a X virtual terminal (VT) to another VT using
      Ctrl-Alt-Fx while the VBoxSDL window has the input focus, the guest will
      receive Ctrl and Alt keypress events without receiving the corresponding
      key release events. This is an architectural limitation of Linux. In
      order to reset the modifier keys, it is possible to send
      <computeroutput>SIGUSR1</computeroutput> to the VBoxSDL main thread
      (first entry in the <computeroutput>ps</computeroutput> list). For
      example, when switching away to another VT and saving the virtual
      machine from this terminal, the following sequence can be used to make
      sure the VM is not saved with stuck modifiers:</para>

      <para><screen>kill -usr1 &lt;pid&gt;
VBoxManage controlvm "Windows 2000" savestate</screen></para>

    <title id="autologon">Automated guest logons</title>

    <para>VirtualBox provides Guest Addition modules for Windows, Linux and
    Solaris to enable automated logons on the guest.</para>

    <para>When a guest operating system is running in a virtual machine, it
    might be desirable to perform coordinated and automated logons using
    credentials from a master logon system. (With "credentials", we are
    referring to logon information consisting of user name, password and
    domain name, where each value might be empty.)</para>

    <sect2 id="autologon_win">
      <title>Automated Windows guest logons</title>

      <para>Since Windows NT, Windows has provided a modular system logon
      subsystem ("Winlogon") which can be customized and extended by means of
      so-called GINA modules (Graphical Identification and Authentication).
      With Windows Vista and Windows 7, the GINA modules were replaced with a
      new mechanism called "credential providers". The VirtualBox Guest
      Additions for Windows come with both, a GINA and a credential provider
      module, and therefore enable any Windows guest to perform automated
      logons.</para>

      <para>To activate the VirtualBox GINA or credential provider module,
      install the Guest Additions with using the command line switch
      <computeroutput>/with_autologon</computeroutput>. All the following
      manual steps required for installing these modules will be then done by
      the installer.</para>

      <para>To manually install the VirtualBox GINA module, extract the Guest
      Additions (see <xref linkend="windows-guest-file-extraction" />) and
      copy the file <computeroutput>VBoxGINA.dll</computeroutput> to the
      Windows <computeroutput>SYSTEM32</computeroutput> directory. Then, in
      the registry, create the following key: <screen>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GinaDLL</screen>
      with a value of <computeroutput>VBoxGINA.dll</computeroutput>.</para>

      <para><note>
          The VirtualBox GINA is implemented as a wrapper around the standard Windows
          GINA (<computeroutput>MSGINA.DLL</computeroutput>),
          therefore it will most likely not work correctly with 3rd party GINA modules. 
        </note></para>

      <para>To manually install the VirtualBox credential module, extract the
      Guest Additions (see <xref linkend="windows-guest-file-extraction" />)
      and copy the file <computeroutput>VBoxCredProv.dll</computeroutput> to
      the Windows <computeroutput>SYSTEM32</computeroutput> directory. Then,
      in the registry, create the following keys:<screen>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\

      named <screen>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{275D3BCC-22BB-4948-A7F6-3A3054EBA92B}\InprocServer32\ThreadingModel</screen>
      with a value of <computeroutput>Apartment</computeroutput> has to be

      <para>To set credentials, use the following command on a
      <emphasis>running</emphasis> VM:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage controlvm "Windows XP" setcredentials "John Doe" "secretpassword" "DOMTEST"</screen>

      <para>While the VM is running, the credentials can be queried by the
      VirtualBox logon modules (GINA or credential provider) using the
      VirtualBox Guest Additions device driver. When Windows is in "logged
      out" mode, the logon modules will constantly poll for credentials and if
      they are present, a logon will be attempted. After retrieving the
      credentials, the logon modules will erase them so that the above command
      will have to be repeated for subsequent logons.</para>

      <para>For security reasons, credentials are not stored in any persistent
      manner and will be lost when the VM is reset. Also, the credentials are
      "write-only", i.e. there is no way to retrieve the credentials from the
      host side. Credentials can be reset from the host side by setting empty
      values.</para>

      <para>Depending on the particular variant of the Windows guest, the

            Secure Attention Sequence. Also, the user name given is only
            compared to the true user name, not the user friendly name. This
            means that when you rename a user, you still have to supply the
            original user name (internally, Windows never renames user
            accounts).</para>

      <title>Automated Linux/Unix guest logons</title>

      <para>Starting with version 3.2, VirtualBox provides a custom PAM module
      (Pluggable Authentication Module) which can be used to perform automated
      guest logons on platforms which support this framework. Virtually all

      do the actual validation using the credentials retrieved by

      <title>Automated Windows system preparation</title>

      <para>Beginning with Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft offers a "system
      preparation" tool (in short: Sysprep) to prepare a Windows system for
      deployment or redistribution. Whereas Windows 2000 and XP ship with
      Sysprep on the installation medium, the tool also is available for
      download on the Microsoft web site. In a standard installation of
      Windows Vista and 7, Sysprep is already included. Sysprep mainly
      consists of an executable called
      <computeroutput>sysprep.exe</computeroutput> which is invoked by the
      user to put the Windows installation into preparation mode.</para>

      <para>Starting with VirtualBox 3.2.2, the Guest Additions offer a way to
      launch a system preparation on the guest operating system in an
      automated way, controlled from the host system. To achieve that, see
      <xref linkend="guestadd-guestcontrol" /> for using the feature with the
      special identifier <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> as the
      program to execute, along with the user name
      <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> and password
      <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> for the credentials. Sysprep
      then gets launched with the required system rights.</para>

    <title>CPU hot-plugging</title>

    <para>With virtual machines running modern server operating systems,
    VirtualBox supports CPU hot-plugging.<footnote>
        <para>Support for CPU hot-plugging was introduced with VirtualBox
        3.2.</para>
      </footnote> Whereas on a physical computer this would mean that a CPU
    can be added or removed while the machine is running, VirtualBox supports
    adding and removing virtual CPUs while a virtual machine is
    running.</para>

    <para>CPU hot-plugging works only with guest operating systems that
    support it. So far this applies only to Linux and Windows Server 2008 x64
    Data Center Edition. Windows supports only hot-add while Linux supports
    hot-add and hot-remove but to use this feature with more than 8 CPUs a
    64bit Linux guest is required.</para>

    <para>At this time, CPU hot-plugging requires using the VBoxManage
    command-line interface. First, hot-plugging needs to be enabled for a
    virtual machine:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --cpuhotplug on</screen></para>

    <para>After that, the --cpus option specifies the maximum number of CPUs
    that the virtual machine can have:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --cpus 8</screen>When
    the VM is off, you can then add and remove virtual CPUs with the modifyvm
    --plugcpu and --unplugcpu subcommands, which take the number of the
    virtual CPU as a parameter, like this:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --plugcpu 3
VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --unplugcpu 3</screen>Note that CPU 0 can never
    be removed.</para>

    <para>While the VM is running, CPUs can be added with the
    <computeroutput>controlvm plugcpu/unplugcpu</computeroutput> commands
    instead:<screen>VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" plugcpu 3
VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" unplugcpu 3</screen></para>

    <para>See <xref linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" /> and <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-controlvm" /> for details.</para>

    <para>With Linux guests, the following applies: To prevent ejection while
    the CPU is still used it has to be ejected from within the guest before.
    The Linux Guest Additions contain a service which receives hot-remove
    events and ejects the CPU. Also, after a CPU is added to the VM it is not
    automatically used by Linux. The Linux Guest Additions service will take
    care of that if installed. If not a CPU can be started with the following
    command:<screen>echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu&lt;id&gt;/online</screen></para>

      <title>Custom VESA resolutions</title>

      <para>Apart from the standard VESA resolutions, the VirtualBox VESA BIOS
      allows you to add up to 16 custom video modes which will be reported to
      the guest operating system. When using Windows guests with the
      VirtualBox Guest Additions, a custom graphics driver will be used
      instead of the fallback VESA solution so this information does not
      apply.</para>

      <para>Additional video modes can be configured for each VM using the
      extra data facility. The extra data key is called
      <literal>CustomVideoMode&lt;x&gt;</literal> with <literal>x</literal>
      being a number from 1 to 16. Please note that modes will be read from 1
      until either the following number is not defined or 16 is reached. The
      following example adds a video mode that corresponds to the native
      display resolution of many notebook computers:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "CustomVideoMode1" "1400x1050x16"</screen>

      <para>The VESA mode IDs for custom video modes start at
      <literal>0x160</literal>. In order to use the above defined custom video
      mode, the following command line has be supplied to Linux:</para>

      <screen>vga = 0x200 | 0x160
vga = 864</screen>

      <para>For guest operating systems with VirtualBox Guest Additions, a
      custom video mode can be set using the video mode hint feature.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Configuring the maximum resolution of guests when using the
      graphical frontend</title>

      <para>When guest systems with the Guest Additions installed are started
      using the graphical frontend (the normal VirtualBox application), they
      will not be allowed to use screen resolutions greater than the host's
      screen size unless the user manually resizes them by dragging the
      window, switching to fullscreen or seamless mode or sending a video mode
      hint using VBoxManage. This behavior is what most users will want, but
      if you have different needs, it is possible to change it by issuing one
      of the following commands from the command line:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata global GUI/MaxGuestResolution any</screen>

      <para>will remove all limits on guest resolutions.</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata global GUI/MaxGuestResolution &gt;width,height&lt;</screen>

      <para>manually specifies a maximum resolution.</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata global GUI/MaxGuestResolution auto</screen>

      <title>Custom external authentication modules</title>

      <para>As described in <xref linkend="vbox-auth" />, VirtualBox supports
      arbitrary external modules to perform authentication. When the
      authentication method is set to "external" for a
      particular VM, VirtualBox calls the library that was specified with
      <computeroutput>VBoxManage setproperty vrdeauthlibrary</computeroutput>.
      This library will be loaded by the VM process on demand, i.e. when the
      first RDP connection is made by an external client.</para>

      <para>External authentication is the most flexible as the external
      handler can both choose to grant access to everyone (like the "null"
      authentication method would) and delegate the request to the guest
      authentication component. When delegating the request to the guest
      component, it will still be called afterwards with the option to
      override the result.</para>

      <para>An authentication library is required to implement exactly one
      entry point:</para>

      <para>A note regarding the UUID implementation of the first argument:
      VirtualBox uses a consistent binary representation of UUIDs on all
      platforms. For this reason the integer fields comprising the UUID are
      stored as little endian values. If you want to pass such UUIDs to code
      which assumes that the integer fields are big endian (often also called
      network byte order), you need to adjust the contents of the UUID to e.g.
      achieve the same string representation. The required changes
      are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>reverse the order of byte 0, 1, 2 and 3</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>Using this conversion you will get identical results
      when converting the binary UUID to the string representation.</para>

      <para>The second arguments contains information about the guest
      authentication status. For the first call, it is always set to
      <computeroutput>VRDPAuthGuestNotAsked</computeroutput>. In case the

      <computeroutput>VRDPAuthDelegateToGuest</computeroutput>, a guest
      authentication will be attempted and another call to the method is made
      with its result. This can be either granted / denied or no judgement
      (the guest component chose for whatever reason to not make a decision).
      In case there is a problem with the guest authentication module (e.g.
      the Additions are not installed or not running or the guest did not
      respond within a timeout), the "not reacted" status will be
      returned.</para>

      <title>Using a raw host hard disk from a guest</title>

      <para>Starting with version 1.4, as an alternative to using virtual disk
      images (as described in detail in <xref linkend="storage" />),
      VirtualBox can also present either entire physical hard disks or
      selected partitions thereof as virtual disks to virtual machines.</para>

      <para>With VirtualBox, this type of access is called "raw hard disk
      access"; it allows a guest operating system to access its virtual hard
      disk without going through the host OS file system. The actual
      performance difference for image files vs. raw disk varies greatly
      depending on the overhead of the host file system, whether dynamically
      growing images are used and on host OS caching strategies. The caching
      indirectly also affects other aspects such as failure behavior, i.e.
      whether the virtual disk contains all data written before a host OS
      crash. Consult your host OS documentation for details on this.</para>

      <para><warning>
          <para>Raw hard disk access is for expert users only. Incorrect use
          or use of an outdated configuration can lead to <emphasis
          role="bold">total loss of data </emphasis>on the physical disk. Most
          importantly, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> attempt to boot the
          partition with the currently running host operating system in a
          guest. This will lead to severe data corruption.</para>
        </warning></para>

      <para>Raw hard disk access -- both for entire disks and individual
      partitions -- is implemented as part of the VMDK image format support.
      As a result, you will need to create a special VMDK image file which
      defines where the data will be stored. After creating such a special
      VMDK image, you can use it like a regular virtual disk image. For
      example, you can use the Virtual Media Manager (<xref linkend="vdis" />)
      or <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> to assign the image to a
      virtual machine.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Access to entire physical hard disk</title>

        <para>While this variant is the simplest to set up, you must be aware
        that this will give a guest operating system direct and full access to
        an <emphasis>entire physical disk</emphasis>. If your
        <emphasis>host</emphasis> operating system is also booted from this
        disk, please take special care to not access the partition from the
        guest at all. On the positive side, the physical disk can be
        repartitioned in arbitrary ways without having to recreate the image
        file that gives access to the raw disk.</para>

        <para>To create an image that represents an entire physical hard disk
        (which will not contain any actual data, as this will all be stored on
        the physical disk), on a Linux host, use the command<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda</screen>This creates the image
        <code>/path/to/file.vmdk</code> (must be absolute), and all data will
        be read and written from <code>/dev/sda</code>.</para>

        <para>On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
        use e.g. <code>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</code>. On a Mac OS X host, instead
        of the above device specification use e.g. <code>/dev/disk1</code>.
        Note that on OS X you can only get access to an entire disk if no
        volume is mounted from it.</para>

        <para>Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
        device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the image
        from a virtual machine.</para>

        <para>Just like with regular disk images, this does not automatically
        register the newly created image in the internal registry of hard
        disks. If you want this done automatically, add
        <code>-register</code>: <screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -register</screen>After registering, you can assign
        the newly created image to a virtual machine with e.g. <screen>VBoxManage storageattach WindowsXP --storagectl "IDE Controller"
      --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium /path/to/file.vmdk</screen>When
        this is done the selected virtual machine will boot from the specified
        physical disk.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Access to individual physical hard disk partitions</title>

        <para>This "raw partition support" is quite similar to the "full hard
        disk" access described above. However, in this case, any partitioning
        information will be stored inside the VMDK image, so you can e.g.
        install a different boot loader in the virtual hard disk without
        affecting the host's partitioning information. While the guest will be
        able to <emphasis>see</emphasis> all partitions that exist on the
        physical disk, access will be filtered in that reading from partitions
        for which no access is allowed the partitions will only yield zeroes,
        and all writes to them are ignored.</para>

        <para>To create a special image for raw partition support (which will
        contain a small amount of data, as already mentioned), on a Linux
        host, use the command<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5</screen></para>

        <para>As you can see, the command is identical to the one for "full
        hard disk" access, except for the additional
        <computeroutput>-partitions</computeroutput> parameter. This example
        would create the image <code>/path/to/file.vmdk</code> (which, again,
        must be absolute), and partitions 1 and 5 of <code>/dev/sda</code>
        would be made accessible to the guest.</para>

        <para>VirtualBox uses the same partition numbering as your Linux host.
        As a result, the numbers given in the above example would refer to the
        first primary partition and the first logical drive in the extended
        partition, respectively.</para>

        <para>On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
        use e.g. <code>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</code>. On a Mac OS X host, instead
        of the above device specification use e.g. <code>/dev/disk1</code>.
        Note that on OS X you can only use partitions which are not mounted
        (eject the respective volume first). Partition numbers are the same on
        Linux, Windows and Mac OS X hosts.</para>

        <para>The numbers for the list of partitions can be taken from the
        output of<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands listpartitions -rawdisk /dev/sda</screen>The
        output lists the partition types and sizes to give the user enough
        information to identify the partitions necessary for the guest.</para>

        <para>Images which give access to individual partitions are specific
        to a particular host disk setup. You cannot transfer these images to
        another host; also, whenever the host partitioning changes, the image
        <emphasis>must be recreated</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
        device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the image
        from a virtual machine. If this is not feasible, there is a special
        variant for raw partition access (currently only available on Linux
        hosts) that avoids having to give the current user access to the
        entire disk. To set up such an image, use<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5 -relative</screen>When used from a
        virtual machine, the image will then refer not to the entire disk, but
        only to the individual partitions (in the example
        <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sda5</code>). As a consequence,
        read/write access is only required for the affected partitions, not
        for the entire disk. During creation however, read-only access to the
        entire disk is required to obtain the partitioning information.</para>

        <para>In some configurations it may be necessary to change the MBR
        code of the created image, e.g. to replace the Linux boot loader that
        is used on the host by another boot loader. This allows e.g. the guest
        to boot directly to Windows, while the host boots Linux from the
        "same" disk. For this purpose the
        <computeroutput>-mbr</computeroutput> parameter is provided. It
        specifies a file name from which to take the MBR code. The partition
        table is not modified at all, so a MBR file from a system with totally
        different partitioning can be used. An example of this is<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5 -mbr winxp.mbr</screen>The modified
        MBR will be stored inside the image, not on the host disk.</para>

        <para>For each of the above variants, you can register the resulting
        image for immediate use in VirtualBox by adding
        <computeroutput>-register</computeroutput> to the respective command
        line. The image will then immediately appear in the list of registered
        disk images. An example is<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5 -relative -register</screen> which
        creates an image referring to individual partitions, and registers it
        when the image is successfully created.</para>

    <title>Legacy commands for using serial ports</title>

    <para>Starting with version 1.4, VirtualBox provided support for virtual
    serial ports, which, at the time, was rather complicated to set up with a
    sequence of <computeroutput>VBoxManage setextradata</computeroutput>
    statements. Since version 1.5, that way of setting up serial ports is no
    longer necessary and <emphasis>deprecated.</emphasis> To set up virtual
    serial ports, use the methods now described in <xref
    linkend="serialports" />.<note>
        <para>For backwards compatibility, the old
        <computeroutput>setextradata</computeroutput> statements, whose
        description is retained below from the old version of the manual, take
        <emphasis>precedence</emphasis> over the new way of configuring serial
        ports. As a result, if configuring serial ports the new way doesn't
        work, make sure the VM in question does not have old configuration
        data such as below still active.</para>
      </note></para>

    <para>The old sequence of configuring a serial port used the following 6
      commands:</para><screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/Config/IRQ" 4
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/Config/IOBase" 0x3f8
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/LUN#0/Driver" Char
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Driver" NamedPipe
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/Location" "\\.\pipe\vboxCOM1"
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/serial/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/IsServer" 1</screen>
    <para>This sets up a serial port in the guest with the default
    settings for COM1 (IRQ 4, I/O address 0x3f8) and the
    <computeroutput>Location</computeroutput> setting assumes that this
    configuration is used on a Windows host, because the Windows named pipe
    syntax is used. Keep in mind that on Windows hosts a named pipe must
    always start with <computeroutput>\\.\pipe\</computeroutput>. On Linux the
    same config settings apply, except that the path name for the
    <computeroutput>Location</computeroutput> can be chosen more freely. Local
    domain sockets can be placed anywhere, provided the user running
    VirtualBox has the permission to create a new file in the directory. The
    final command above defines that VirtualBox acts as a server, i.e. it
    creates the named pipe itself instead of connecting to an already existing
    one.</para>

      <para>By default, VirtualBox keeps all sources of time visible to the

      This reflects the assumptions of many guest operating systems, which
      expect all time sources to reflect "wall clock" time. In special

      counter) in the guest reflect the time actually spent executing the
      guest.</para>

      <para>This special TSC handling mode can be enabled on a per-VM basis,

      timeouts for virtual devices with the result that a slightly increased

      cause guest failures. Note further that any time synchronization
      mechanism will frequently try to resynchronize the guest clock with the

    <para><screen>rem_drv vboxnet</screen>then edit the file
    <computeroutput>/platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/vboxnet.conf</computeroutput>
    and add a line for the new interfaces:</para>

    <para><screen>name="vboxnet" parent="pseudo" instance=1;
name="vboxnet" parent="pseudo" instance=2;</screen>Add as many of these lines
    as required and make sure "instance" number is uniquely incremented. Next
    reload the vboxnet driver using:</para>

    <para><screen>add_drv vboxnet</screen>Now plumb all the interfaces using
    <computeroutput>ifconfig vboxnetX plumb</computeroutput> (where X can be
    0, 1 or 2 in this case) and once plumbed you can then configure the
    interface like any other network interface.</para>

    <para>To make your newly added interfaces' settings persistent across
    reboots you will need to edit the files
    <computeroutput>/etc/netmasks</computeroutput>, and if you are using NWAM
    <computeroutput>/etc/nwam/llp</computeroutput> and add the appropriate
    entries to set the netmask and static IP for each of those interfaces. The

    <para><computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput> is used for controlling
    VirtualBox remotely. As the client base using this interface is growing,
    we added start scripts for the various operation systems we support. The
    following describes how to use them. <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>On Mac OS X, launchd is used. An example configuration file
          can be found in
          <computeroutput>$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/org.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist</computeroutput>.
          It has to be enabled by changing the
          <computeroutput>Disabled</computeroutput> key from
          <computeroutput>true</computeroutput> to
          <computeroutput>false</computeroutput>. To manually start the
          service use the following command: <screen>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist</screen>
          For additional information on how launchd services could be
          configured see <literal><ulink
